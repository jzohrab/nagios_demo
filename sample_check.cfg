# DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE.  During vagrant provisioning of the server
# (in provision_server.sh), this file is COPIED to the Nagios server
# as the following:

#    /usr/local/nagios/etc/servers/client.cfg.

# If you are trying to change the configuration of your running
# Nagios server, you should instead be editing the above file on the
# server.  See "Configuration" in the README.
